## üíª About the project
This is a backend-only application for managing products in a snackbar, following an hexagonal architecture.

The application is written in Java 21 using Spring Boot, built using Maven 3.9.9, uses MongoDB 8.0.1 as database, and runs containerized using Docker 27.2 and Docker Compose 2.29 on container images based on Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat) of amd64 architecture.

The Domain Drive Design (DDD) diagrams that define the main application flows are accessible in this Miro board: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLK2yXLA=/

The two videos that describe the user flow and the admin flow are hosted in Youtube in the following links (only visible through the links, not searcheable):

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è Running the Application
</p>

The application repository is privately hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/commskywalker/snackbar), with access allowed only to specific users.

### To run the application: 
* Ensure you are running a system with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Ubuntu 22 or 24 installed, Ubuntu 22 or 24 directly or MacOS Sequoia (version 15)
* Ensure you have Git installed on your system
* Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

```bash
# Create a new directory
$ mkdir grupo-82
# Access the new directory
$ cd grupo-82
# Clone this repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/commskywalker/snackbar.git
# Access the cloned repository directory
$ cd snackbar
# Build and start the application in background using the command:
$ docker-compose up -d --build

```
The application will start and be accessible at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

#### Other Docker Compose instructions:
```bash
# To build and start the application in foreground with the logs displaying in the console, use the following command:
$ docker-compose up --build

# Stop the application using the command:
$ docker-compose down -v
# If you were running in foregroud with logs displaying, use Ctrl+C in the terminal where docker-compose is running and then the command above

```

<p id="endpoints">
   
## üìçAPI Endpoints
</p>

* Before testing the APIs, ensure you have [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or similar installed on your system.
* The MongoDB "snackbar" database comes with two collections pre-loaded: "products" and "orders".

The application exposes the following REST API endpoints:

## üìÑ Accessing the Swagger UI
</p>

You can access the Swagger UI to explore and test the APIs at:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

<p id="architecture">
	
## üèõÔ∏è Application Architecture
</p>

This application follows a hexagonal architecture, also known as ports and adapters architecture. The main components are:

- Domain: Contains the core business logic and entities (e.g., Product).
- Application: Defines the use cases and interfaces for the application (e.g., ProductService).
- Infrastructure: Implements the interfaces defined in the application layer (e.g., ProductRepository).
- Web: Handles the HTTP requests and responses (e.g., ProductController).

This architecture promotes separation of concerns and makes the application more modular and testable.

<p id="database">
	
## üóÉÔ∏è Database
</p>
This application uses MongoDB as its database. The MongoDB database name is "snackbar". It requires authentication and have pre-loaded an administrative user and a regular user, this last one used by the Java application with read/write access only to the "snackbar" database. 

<p id="run-outside">
	
## ‚ùïIf you need to Recompile/Run the Application outside of the container
</p>


### To run the application directly using Java and Maven:

1. Ensure you have Java 21 installed on your system. You can check your Java version by running:
<h6>üí°If you don't have Java 21, download and install it from the official Oracle website or use a package manager. </h6>

   ```
   java -version
   ```


2. Make sure you have Maven 3.9.9 installed. You can check your Maven version by running:
   ```
   mvn -version
   ```

3. Navigate in your terminal to the project's root directory (where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located).
```bash
# Build the project using Maven:
$ mvn -f ./backend/pom.xml package

# Run the application:
$ java -jar ./backend/target/snackbar-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

```
